Fosshost announces that Nate Sales, Chief Technology Officer, has directed his focus to the network and will step down from his position to Director of Infrastructure.

Chris Johnson will replace Nate and assume the role of Chief Technology Officer on an interim basis. The board will provide an update on that process as and when appropriate.

Thomas Markey, Chief Executive of Fosshost, said, "The board and I would like to thank Nate for his significant contributions to the project as CTO. We will continue to work with Nate in his new role, which will instead focus on networking and infrastructure. Nate is very much still an active member of the team and as a co-founder of the project, will continue to attend board meetings in full capacity."
