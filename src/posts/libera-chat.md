In response to the recent mass resignation of volunteer staff from Freenode, an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network for Free Software communities, Fosshost is migrating its IRC presence to Libera Chat, a new IRC network with a similar focus founded by former Freenode staff.

Fosshost has been present on Freenode since our formation in March 2020.  Throughout our tenure we have experienced only dedication, care, and professionalism from the network's volunteer staff. When they feel forced to resign and launch a new network, we follow to continue experiencing the same level of care and dedication.

All existing users of the `#fosshost` family of channels on Freenode are invited to join us in `#fosshost` and friends. on Libera Chat.
For the time being it is still possible to send a meesage to us by chatting in Freenode #fosshost.  This will forward a message to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pEU5eZ9hhh) which now is generally bridge with our channels on Libera.Chat.  All of our other channels on Freenode forward to #fosshost.  As always, you can start a conversation with our team by email.
