In response to the recent mass resignation of volunteer staff from Freenode, an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network for Free Software communities, Fosshost is migrating its IRC presence to Libera Chat, a new IRC network with a similar focus founded by former Freenode staff.

Fosshost has been present on Freenode since our formation in March 2020.  Throughout our tenure, we have experienced only dedication, care, and professionalism from the network's volunteer staff. When they feel forced to resign and launch a new network, we follow to continue experiencing the same level of care and dedication.

All existing users of the `#fosshost` family of channels on Freenode are invited to join us in `#fosshost` and friends. on Libera Chat.
For the time being it is still possible to send a message to us by chatting in Freenode #fosshost.  This will forward a message to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pEU5eZ9hhh) which now is otherwise bridged with our channels on Libera.Chat.  Our other channels on Freenode forward to #fosshost.

As always, you can start a conversation with our team by email.

# Our Channels

 * #fosshost -our main channel, Q&A and discussion
 * #fosshost-incident - tenant issue triage
 * #fosshost-social - leasure time, off-topic chat welcome

We would like to thank Freenode for hosting us up to now.  We also want to thank [FSFE](https://fsfe.org/) from whom we've "borrowed" much of the language of this post.

We look forward to seeing you on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat).
