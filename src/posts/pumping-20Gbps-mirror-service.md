One of the services we offer to the FOSS community is the mirror service. With it, we allow open-source projects to have their content mirrored in dozens of servers worldwide, thanks to [Fastly's](https://fastly.com) sponsorship and their growing [network of servers](https://www.fastly.com/network-map/).

The projects using our mirror service are, all combined, pumping an impressive 20Gbps. At the time of writing, we have fourteen tenants for this service, which makes this even more exciting. You can see who is using our mirror service by visiting our [mirror address](http://mirrors.fossho.st/).

We are happy to reach this milestone and hope this number increases to three digits.
