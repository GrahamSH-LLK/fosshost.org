Recently, we were invited to write about Fosshost for OpenUK. OpenUK is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, based in the United Kingdom, advocating for Open Technology - open-source software, open-source hardware, and open data. 

The advocacy made by the nice folks at OpenUK is directed at individuals, businesses, and the public sector across the United Kingdom. Their mission is, quoting from their website: 

- lead and advocate for the use and development of Open technology and associated services while interacting with law and policy makers. 

- be a single voice for the Open industries, representing and bringing together Open in the UK. 

- build a body of expertise and experience and provide tools and resources about the Open sectors.

OpenUK is now at the second phase of their “[State of Open](https://openuk.uk/stateofopen/)” survey. This focuses on the state of Open Technology in the UK.  Participation is open until June 13, 11:59 BST, so please do respond soon! The third and final phase will start in September. 

Like Fosshost, OpenUK is made up of partners, volunteers, and supporters who share a common value around Open Technology. 

We wish them all the best and hope they fulfill their mission and vision to become the beacon for Open Technology in the UK.
