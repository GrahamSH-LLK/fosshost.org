Dear Projects and Friends;

It's that time of the year again where we will be shortly waving goodbye to 2021, definitely an exciting year here at Fosshost as we have continued to serve the Free Software Community with our cloud-hosting services. **As many as 250 open-source projects are now utilizing our services to develop, build, test and compile software.**

**Without a doubt, 2021 has been our busiest year so far.** We have added new sponsors, founded our AArch64 platform, and launched our new branding to reflect our vision and mission this month.

**We also created our Advisory Committee Board (ACB) to provide independent and external oversight to our Board of Directors**, ensuring our decisions are the best for the communities we serve. We realized that some of our choices earlier this year meant improving our governance and approach to making decisions. **We have listened and taken steps to make sure that we do better.**

**Our sponsors continue to provide fantastic support to our project.** More sponsors are in the pipeline for 2022 to help us achieve increased cloud regions, density and capacity as we continue serving the community.

Further improvements in the new year will include a refreshed website to accommodate our new branding.

**I wish to personally say "Thank You" to every project that has supported us this year.** Feedback from projects is essential to providing world-class service to the Free Software Community, and we welcome it across our support channels.

With the new Covid-19 variant comes continued impact in many shapes and sizes and disruption to the communities we live in. **If you know of any impacted by the pandemic, who may struggle to host their project, please tell them to speak to us.** We will do our best to accommodate their project, subject to our eligibility criteria.

Due to some technical changes and improvements in Q3 and Q4 of this year, we temporarily suspended all new applications to deal with existing issues and requests for current tenants. **I am pleased to report that we are making significant progress, and we will be switching on the applications again in the New Year.**

We will all take some downtime during the holidays, with the Christmas Change Freeze, to reflect on some of those achievements. I will be spending quality time with close friends and family, whilst others may continue to do what they love: writing software.

**Thank you once again for your continued support. I am looking forward to working with you again in 2022.** Please reach out to me directly if there is anything I can do to help.

All the best;

Thomas Markey (thomas@fosshost.org)
