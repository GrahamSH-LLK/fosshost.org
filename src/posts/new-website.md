We are very proud to announce the launch of the new website for Fosshost.

Our efforts were focused on providing a more streamlined, faster and simplified layout while also making it reflect our brand and our new logo, which we announced in mid-December 2021.

In case you don't remember, our new logo is an Owl. The Owl is associated with wisdom, good luck, prosperity, and vigilance in ancient and modern European cultures, Asian cultures, and Hinduism.

We believe the FOSS community will find it easier to navigate and reach all the information needed to apply to our services.
