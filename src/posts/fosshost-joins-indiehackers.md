Fosshost joins indiehackers to support the start up community using open source technology.  Our position remains clear that we will continue to operate as a not-for-profit but the opportunities available within the indiehackers community will allow fosshost to support fledgling developers, small projects and ideas.  We shall advocate, promote and act as a catalyst to the use of free open software. Further to this, we can provide domain registration services to eligible projects.  Feel free to [follow us!](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/fosshost)
