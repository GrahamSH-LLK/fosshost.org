In December, we had a growing backlog - related to current and future projects - to complete. To prevent it from getting to a Godzilla-like size, we decided to shift our primary focus toward it. We also had to continue supporting our fantastic tenants, so we temporarily disabled the applications.

Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers, we are delighted to inform you the application form is available again. All FOSS projects who wish to apply can do so at [fosshost.org/apply](https://fosshost.org/apply). However, we advise you to read our *[wiki](https://docs.fosshost.org/general/application/)* first, as it contains essential information about the application process.

In light of the conflict happening in Ukraine, we are *expediting* applications from FOSS projects and developers in Ukraine and other impacted communities.

Let's work together towards a [#FOSSFuture](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FOSSFuture)!
