As we grow, scalability becomes more and more critical for our success and the success of the open-source projects we support with our set of services. Quoting Charles Darwin: "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works co-operatively against common threats."

To continue to scale and adapt, we suspended the applications. We understand this is inconvenient to open-source projects considering subscribing to our services. However, we feel this move will allow us to undergo internal changes that will enable us to scale better in the future.

We appreciate your understanding and promise to do it as fast as qualitatively possible.
