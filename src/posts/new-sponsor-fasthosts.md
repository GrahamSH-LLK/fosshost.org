Every day, we strive to achieve our number one objective: empowering and supporting every free and open-source software project. A crucial part of this goal is sponsorship. Thanks to our sponsors, we can provide free services and impact the FOSS community. We are very thankful to them for trusting us and helping us pursue our mission to empower and support every free and open-source software project!

A cornerstone in pursuing our goal is our newest sponsor, [Fasthosts](https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/). Fasthosts is a hosting provider based in the UK, operating since 1999. Their experience, combined with innovation and the offering of the latest technologies, makes the company a rock-solid choice for hosting projects.

[Fasthosts](https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/) is sponsoring us with a server, located in one of their UK datacenters, with the following specs:

- **CPU:** Intel Xeon Gold 6210U (20 cores x 2.5GHz)
- **RAM:** 192GB
- **HDD:** 2x4TB RAID 1

The new hardware will help us accommodate the increasing number of tenants and provide an even better service. It will also allow us to fulfil our vision and be a trustworthy entity for our sponsors.

We are very proud of having [Fasthosts])(https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/) sponsoring us, and we'll do our best to uphold the trust you placed in us.
