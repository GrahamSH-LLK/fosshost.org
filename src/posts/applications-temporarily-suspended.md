During the last few weeks, we have been receiving an increasingly high number of applications. Due to this massive increase, we have temporarily suspended our application form to deal with the existing ones in a timely fashion. There may be, though, delays in the responses because the number of pending applications is enormous.

Our volunteers are doing their best to reply to all applicants, so we can restore the form as fast as possible. Thank you for understanding.


**Update - Aug. 24, 2022:**
Fosshost is currently undergoing restructuring and we are not accepting new applications.  There is no timelines for when we will accept new applications.  We are sorry for this and thank you for your patience.
