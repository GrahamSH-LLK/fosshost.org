During the last few weeks, we have been receiving an increasingly high number of applications. Due to this massive increase, we have temporarily suspended our application form to deal with the existing ones in a timely fashion. There may be, though, delays in the responses because the number of pending applications is enormous.

Our volunteers are doing their best to reply to all applicants, so we can restore the form as fast as possible. Thank you for understanding.

**Update - Aug. 11, 2021:**
Applications have been temporarily re-suspended to again allow for the clearing of our current backlog. The application form is expected to reopen two weeks from today.

**Update - Sep. 18, 2021:**
We're currently revamping our applications process due to rapid growth and in order to scale our systems, we require a small break.  Please check back later, when we may be able to accept your application.  Thank you for your interest in Fosshost and for everything you are doing to support the open-source ecosystem.

**Update - Nov. 30, 2021:**
We have paused new applications for the time being whilst we complete some infrastructure restructuring.  We hope this won't take long and that we can accept new applications before the end of the current year.  Please check back later and thank you for your continued support and patience.
