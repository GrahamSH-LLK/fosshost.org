This means that we can now provide cloaks to project members and volunteers and receive formal recognition for our efforts, as well as the use of cloaks.

Please contact eth01 in #fosshost if you would like to avail a cloak to show your support to the project (cloaks are only available to projects we have accepted onto the project) or our volunteers.
