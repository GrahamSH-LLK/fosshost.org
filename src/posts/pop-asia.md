When our tenants and the Free Software community give us feedback, we listen. One of the most frequent requests is the diversification of our PoP's. As we [wrote](https://fosshost.org/news/diversifying-geographical-presence) before, we have already started this process.

Today, we are delighted to announce a new PoP in Singapore. The server is hosted by OVH and funded by donations.

The Free Software community from the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will now have a server to host their projects with decreased latency. To the best of our knowledge, this makes us the first open-source hosting provider to have a PoP in the APAC region.

We hope this is the first of many servers in this region. If you are a company or an individual who wants to support the Asian Free Software community with more PoPs, [reach out to us](https://fosshost.org/contact).
