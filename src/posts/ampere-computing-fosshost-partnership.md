Ampere Computing the ARM-based computer chip processor has agreed to support and work in partnership with fosshost to provide ARM64 v8 hardware which will be provisioned for virtualisation for projects to use for build and development purposes.

Thomas Markey, Founder of fosshost said "The donation of hardware and support from Ampere is testament to our community offering that has helped more than 70 open source projects since our launch in April of this year.  We have received many requests for ARM compute time and I am pleased that we will now be able to start offering this unique service to projects."

The infrastructure will initially be shipped to the UK where it will be situated in an CustodianDC facility whilst we work on a stable boilerplate image.  We are expecting to be able to conclude this work by the end of Dec 2020 and are now accepting interest from new and existing projects who are interested in faster builds, improved testing, and testing deployments on mixed architecture.

The donation by [Ampere Computing](https://amperecomputing.com) is extremely kind, thank you to Ampere and Peter Pouliot!
