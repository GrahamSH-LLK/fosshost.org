Thank you to [mxrlkn](https://mxrlkn.com/) who did a very good job of understanding our requirements and working with the fosshost team to see the website through to delivery.  We are very happy with our new website!  As the summary suggests, our new website is fitting with our mission statement and values.  It perfectly captures our purpose and commitment to improving and assisting the free and open source software community with access to our professional and cloud-based hosting services which we now provide to more than thirty open source projects.
