We have a new sponsor: **UKFast.Net Limited**. The company, founded in 1999 and one of the leading providers in the United Kingdom, is **sponsoring us with the collocation for ten units of our AArch64 hardware**, and IP transit.

The hardware will be hosted at MaNOC6, one of the company's data centres in Manchester. You can read about this Tier 3 data centre on [UKFast's website](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/inside-our-data-centres.html).

**We are very thankful to UKFast.Net Limited and Neil Lathwood**, the company's Chief Technology Officer, who intermediated the sponsorship. We promise to continue to uphold our goals and make the best use of the backing to help and serve the FOSS community. **Thank you for trusting in us.**
