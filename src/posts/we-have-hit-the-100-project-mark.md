Fosshost is now providing distributed cloud hosting services to more than 100 open source software projects, initatives and groups since our launch in April 2020.

This is a tremendous moment for Fosshost and marks an important day and has confirmed that our community and approach is both sustainable and scalable. Further, it would not be possible without the support of our core sponsors.

We regularly maintain and update our projects list.

We have 7 applications in the backlog for our AArch64 platform, further updates regarding the status of the project can be found at the AArch64 blog.

Providing a more general update.

Finally, we'll work on some new brand guidelines and a new website, to give a refreshed look to Fosshost (we've decided one of those is to capitalise the F in Fosshost), which is succint with our future and long term sustainbility model.

We are talking to new core sponsors to see how we can increase our capacity.

Thank you for reading, and we look forward to working with you.

Team Fosshost!
